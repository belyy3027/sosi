    <h1>The second blog is about what I think about CSS</h1>
    <p>I know for sure that I can learn programming, learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but for some reason, every time I start studying, sitting for 5-7 hours every day, I start to burn out and postpone for later, although, I must admit, I don't have a strong desire to work in programming, but I like to study something new as a hobby, and it would be great if I reached the proper level and was able to promote myself in this and earn additional income</p>
